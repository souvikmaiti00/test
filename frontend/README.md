# React Native Frontend

This simple React Native application fetches cards from the FastAPI backend and displays them in a list.

## Running

Install dependencies with npm or yarn, then run the app via Expo or React Native CLI:

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`.
